- each node and pod has its own individual ip from communication.

- when node is created internal ip gets created and all pods created inside that node will get assigned from internal ip.

- here comes the conflict when 2 nodes with same internal ip and pods ips exist communication becomes invalid so kubernetes
    asks us to do it ourself there are plenty of tools avilabel in market for kubernetes networking. ex: cisco , cilium ,flannel etc

- by using networking solutions like weave net to config network in kubernetes cluster they assign uniq ips to nodes and pods
    to make communication easy.

- kubernetes services enables the communication between the services inside and outside the application.

- for example there are front-end back-end and datasource pods the services are configured to communicate with each pod with
    another and users

- services are objects just like pods, replicaset

- services types :
    -node port
    -clusterip
    -lodebalancer

- nodeport : node port service will listen on one port and forward requests to pod running application.

- clusterip : in this service clusterip will create

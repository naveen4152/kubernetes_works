replication controller Scenario:
        when single pod running our application, what if our application fails and user no longer to access the application
        to prevent loosing access to application we would like to have more than one app running if one fails another to resond
        the replication controller helps to run more than one pod running.

        when noof users increases the load on single pod will increase so replication controller scale our app when
        demand increases.

- replication controller is old way to replicate the objects. it is replaced with replica set.

- replicaset is an object like pod which replicates the podspec and creates multiple pods based on replicas.
